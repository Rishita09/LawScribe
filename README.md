## 🧠 **AI Models Used**
To deliver top-notch results, **LawScribe** employs several advanced models:

### 🦙 **LLAMA 3**:
**LawScribe** harnesses the power of the **LLAMA 3** (Large Language Model) to understand and generate legal text. This model processes user inputs to create customized, legally compliant document templates. The LLAMA model is also fine-tuned for legal language, ensuring it produces documents that adhere to jurisdiction-specific regulations and industry-specific requirements.

### 🦙 **Tiny LLAMA**:
**Tiny LLAMA** is used for faster and more lightweight operations, such as editing and paraphrasing legal texts. While it maintains the precision of larger models, it focuses on providing quicker responses for smaller-scale document modifications. Tiny LLAMA is ideal for tasks that need to be done in real-time, such as quick text analysis or grammar checks.

### 🔡 **T5 Model**:
The **T5 (Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer)** model is employed for transforming user inputs into well-structured legal documents. It specializes in tasks such as text summarization, paraphrasing, and translating legal jargon into simpler language. This model is essential for helping users understand the content they are working with and for creating concise summaries of legal documents.

## 📊 **Custom Dataset**
We’ve built a **customized dataset** to train and fine-tune these models, specifically tailored for legal document creation. The dataset includes various types of legal documents such as contracts, agreements, wills, leases, and more, ensuring that the models are highly specialized for legal use cases.
